My project requires me to delete the node modules when submitting it to any format because the file size is really large if the node modules are left in the file, which will prevent me from uploading my project because the file size is to large if i dont delete the node modules file.

Adding back the node modules will add all the required packages to make the password wallet functional and working as intended. ( 'yarn install' is the command that should install the node modules back in). There are alternative ways to this if this command doesnt work.
